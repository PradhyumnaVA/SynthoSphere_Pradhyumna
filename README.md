# SynthoSphere_Pradhyumna
I have created this repo for a hackathon project called SynthoSphere.

# 32-bit RISC-V processor 
A 32-bit RISC-V processor is a modern open-source CPU design adhering to the RISC-V ISA. It emphasizes simplicity, performance, and customization.
With a streamlined instruction set and multiple privilege levels, it suits various applications from embedded systems to high-performance computing.

# Synthesis
# Commands for synthesis
    yosys
    read_liberty -lib <relative or abs path>/ lib file 
    read_verilog <top.v> 
    synth -top <topmodule of top.v> -flatten
    dfflibmap -liberty <relative or abs path>/ lib file  
    abc -liberty <relative or abs path>/ lib file ( generates results on ur design â†’ netlist verify them before continuing)
    show <topmodule of top.v>
    write_verilog <netlist_file_name>.v  OR    write_verilog -noattr  <netlist_file_name>.v

# Printing statistics
I have used the "flatten" command along with synthesis command thus hierarchy isn't shown.
The "flatten" command in digital design refers to a process where the hierarchical structure of a design is removed, and all modules and instances are brought to the top level. This results in a single flat design without any hierarchy.

My RTL design is very bulky, so design time would have been very high if i would have synthesised it normally. Thus to decrease the synthesis time i gave "flatten" command. 
One more advantage is number of wires used has decreased drastically, thus synthesised design will look a bit simpler.
