# 32-bit RISC-V processor 

A 32-bit RISC-V processor is a modern open-source CPU design adhering to the RISC-V ISA. It emphasizes simplicity, performance, and customization.
With a streamlined instruction set and multiple privilege levels, it suits various applications from embedded systems to high-performance computing.

# RTL simulation

  # Tools used:

  1. iVerilog: It is a compiler. After compilation it generates a .vcd file which is used for simualtion.
  2. GTKWave: It is a simulator, which is used to view the simulation of our design.

  # Commands for Pre-synthesis work

      iverilog my_design.v tb_my_design.v      # Compile Verilog files
      ./a.out                                  # Run simulation
      
  .vcd file will be generated after these commands, it while be saved in the same directory. 
  
  To simulate the .vcd file GTKWave should be run.

      gtkwave tb_my_design.vcd

  GUI of GTKWave will pop-up, in there you can view your simulation.
      
  # Sidenote:
  To obtain the .vcd file you will have to add these lines in your testbench.
  
      $dumpfile("tb_my_design.vcd");
      $dumpvars(0,tb_module);

# Synthesis

  # Tool used:
  
Yosys: Open-source synthesis tool for designing digital circuits. Transforms RTL code into optimized gate-level representation.
  
  # Commands for synthesis
    
    yosys
    read_liberty -lib <relative or abs path>/ lib file 
    read_verilog <top.v> 
    synth -top <topmodule of top.v> -flatten
    dfflibmap -liberty <relative or abs path>/ lib file  
    abc -liberty <relative or abs path>/ lib file ( generates results on ur design â†’ netlist verify them before continuing)
    opt -purge
    show <topmodule of top.v>
    write_verilog <netlist_file_name>.v  OR    write_verilog -noattr  <netlist_file_name>.v

# Synthesis output

After synthesis is completed, the generated netlist is dumped into a .v file so that we can simalute it and check if it matchs the pre-synthesis outputs. The netlist file is given below.

[Generated Netlist ](https://github.com/PradhyumnaVA/SynthoSphere_Pradhyumna/blob/290ac2d855df325a8d95eed526516c749937ed74/netlist_risc.v)

Netlist: the logic of the file is implemented using these components.

I have used the "flatten" command along with synthesis command thus hierarchy isn't shown.
The "flatten" command in digital design refers to a process where the hierarchical structure of a design is removed, and all modules and instances are brought to the top level. This results in a single flat design without any hierarchy.

My RTL design is very bulky, so design time would have been very high if i would have synthesised it normally. Thus to decrease the synthesis time i gave "flatten" command. 
One more advantage is number of wires used has decreased drastically, thus synthesised design will look a bit simpler.

# Synthesised design
Design of the processor made by connecting the generated netlists.

Before "opt -purge" command is run.

After "opt -purge" command is run.

![after_opt](https://github.com/PradhyumnaVA/SynthoSphere_Pradhyumna/assets/137704414/e6fcd898-254c-4cb8-a3b8-0afee1f0a4ac)

"opt -purge" command does design optimization by purge of unused modules and wires. Makes the design look cleaner.

It is difficult to determine the working of RISCV processor post-synthesis. The pc unit and the alu_control signals are working properly. I'm reading up on RISCV documentation to figure out how to determine the outputs and confirm the proper functioning of RISCV processor post-synthesis.
