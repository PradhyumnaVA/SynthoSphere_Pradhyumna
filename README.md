I have created this repo for a hackathon project called SynthoSphere.

# 32-bit RISC-V processor 
A 32-bit RISC-V processor is a modern open-source CPU design adhering to the RISC-V ISA. It emphasizes simplicity, performance, and customization.
With a streamlined instruction set and multiple privilege levels, it suits various applications from embedded systems to high-performance computing.
